I'm better now . Want to play again ? ,3
 I'll let you break the balls this time . ,4
 Let's get all the balls out of the pockets . ,3
 OK . How much do you want to bet on this game ? ,2
 You are crazy . Gambling is against my principles . ,1
Give me a call tomorrow . ,3
 Okay . ,4
I really need a new pair of trousers . ,1
 Do you ? ,2
" Yes , I do . This one is very old now . ",1
 They look all right to me . ,1
 They ’ re not all right . They ’ re uncomfortable and they look terrible . ,1
 All right . All right . ,1
Would you mind if I ask you whether you are married or not ? ,2
" To be frank , I was married once , and now I'm single . ",1
 Do you mean you got a divorce ? ,2
" Yes , my first marriage was a failure . ",1
what did you do over the weekend ? ,2
 I went a global warming rally in London . It was fantastic to be around so many people who care about the environment . ,1
 do you think there's anything we can do to reverse the damage that's been done already ? ,2
" it might not be possible to fix the problems that we've created for ourselves , but there are lots of things we can do to prevent more damages from happening . ",1
 like what ? ,2
" well , we can use public transport instead of taking our cars for a start . ",1
 what else can we do to protect the environment ? ,2
" if you do have to drive , you should make sure that your car runs on unleaded petrol . Also , your home should use sources of renewable energy . ",1
 how about recycling ? Does that actually help ? ,2
" yes . You should take your glass , paper , plastic , cardboard , and tin cans to a recycling center . ",1
 what do you think is the biggest worry for our future ? ,2
 I think that the issue of greatest concern is having enough sources of clean water for everyone . ,1
 I had no idea you were such as environmentalist before ! ,1
" to be honest , in order for the earth to continue to be a habitable place , we're all going to have to become more interested in the environment . ",1
What a bother having to climb storeys home every day . ,1
 But it's also a sort of exercise and it's good to your health . ,1
 I don't care ! ,1
 You're complaining again . ,1
What do people usually do on Saint Valentine's Day ? ,2
" On that day , boys are supposed to give roses to their sweethearts . ",1
 What will the girls do ? ,2
 They give chocolate in return . ,1
"Excuse me , are you Dr . Smith ? ",2
 Yes I am . And you ... ,1
" I'm David , Joanna's husband . She has to be at work late today . So she asked me to pick you up here . ",1
" So nice to meet you , David . Call me Bill . It's very nice of you to come here . ",1
 My pleasure . ,1
"Hey , Ann . You don't have a pen , do you ? ",3
" Sure , here you go . ",4
" Thanks . I don't suppose you have some paper , too . ",3
 Of course . There you are . ,4
 Thanks so much . I owe you one . ,1
"Please excuse me , but I really have to be going . ",1
" Yes , of course . It was nice to see you . ",1
" It was nice to see you , too . And please give my regards to Mrs.Robbins . ",1
Hey Mark . What are you doing ? ,2
 Just watching some TV . ,1
 Anything interesting on ? ,2
 Not really . Just watching the sports highlight on ESPN . ,1
 So I take it you're pretty bored too . ,1
 Just killing time until I find something to do . What are you going to do ? ,2
 It's Saturday and we are sitting at home doing nothing . What's wrong with us ? ,2
 You wanna shoot some hoops ? ,2
" I already tried to call up some of the guys , but they are all busy . ",1
 Where's your girlfriend ? I thought you were going out with her today . ,2
 She's out shopping with her friends . ,1
 Let's go to Starbucks and think of something to do then . ,3
 Aright . Do you have any cigarettes ? ,2
 I only have a couple left . Why don't you pick some up on the way . ,1
 Ok . See you there in about 30 minutes . ,4
 Aright . See you there . ,1
Bob's sister will go to America . ,1
 Why tell me ? She has nothing to do with me ! ,2
 I thought you wanted to know more about her . ,1
" No , I couldn't care less ! ",1
"hey , Tom , did you enjoy your lunch ? ",2
" oh , don't mention it . It was terrible . ",1
 what ' the matter ? ,2
" the food station was as crowded as usual . I waited for 20 minutes for my sandwich , and when I finally got it the chicken was underdone . ",1
 I see . You simply can't blame the server for this . ,1
" yes , I know . Fast food is so popular in this district . ",1
 that's true . ,1
" anyway , how was your such , Catherine ? ",2
 it was good . I brough lunch from home today . ,1
 you did ? I thought you must feel right at home here as we get as many fast food restaurants as you do in America . ,2
" well , I personally don't like then because i don't believe they are healthy . ",1
" i guess you're right . More often than not , people go there only for convenience . The foods may taste good , but generally speaking , they are high in calories , salt and fat . ",1
" yes . I am wondering that you must believe fast food is your lifestyle , don't you ? ",2
 you bet . Almost all top brands such as McDonald's and KFC are from America . ,1
" well , actually two-thirds of Americans may avoid these places . ",1
 seriously ? ,2
" yeah , it's hard to believe but true . ",1
What's your favorite TV Program ? ,2
 I like variety shows . ,1
" I also like variety shows , but sometimes the host lacks a sense of humor . ",1
 I prefer a variety show without a host . ,1
What's up ? You look low . ,2
 It's my girlfriend . I guess she's playing the army game . ,1
 How come ? ,2
 I saw her dating with her ex-boyfriend again . ,1
 I understand that . But I think maybe it's not a date . You are taking the matter too much to heart . ,1
 Maybe . But it still gets on my nerves . ,1
Did you hear about car accident on Spring Road yesterday ? ,2
" Yes , I did . I heard that they took both drivers to hospital . One needed surgery . ",1
" Yes . I heard he had a few broken bones too , but that the doctors have set the fractures without any problems . ",1
 The second driver was luckier . He had a concussion and needed some stitches for his head wound . ,1
 Yes . He was released from hospital yesterday evening . The other man could be there for weeks . ,1
 I understand that he ’ s connected to a heart monitor and breathing apparatus . His condition can ’ t be very good . ,1
 The hospital announced this morning that his condition is poor but stable . What does that mean ? ,2
" It means he ’ s really badly injured , but he will almost certainly survive . ",1
 His family will be pleased to hear that . They must have been so worried . ,1
"Happy New Year , Bill . ",1
" Happy New Year , Steven . ",1
 Do you have any plans for the New Year holiday ? ,2
 My whole family are going to Hainan for visiting . What about you ? ,2
 How happy you are ! I have to stay at home to prepare my final exam . ,1
"Are you sure Lucy has it bad for you ? If she does , she will certainly bend over backwards for you . But if she doesn't , it would be a job to change her . ",2
" I don't know whether she has it bad for me , but she enjoys being with me . ",1
 And do you really love her ? ,2
 I think I do . I don't think I can be happier with another girl . ,1
A friend of mine is now in the big house . He was caught red-handed for selling cocaine . ,1
 That is a deadly risky business . He should have it coming on him . ,1
 He must be regretting about having done the business . ,1
 I bet he is . He domed his own life . ,1
I met Mark yesterday . He looked blue . ,1
" He ’ s been on the gravy train these years , hasn ’ t he ? ",2
" It belongs to the past . He lost his job the other day , and he ’ s up a tree now . ",1
 It seems that nobody can always expect things to pan out well each time . ,1
"Look , the aliens are sending a message to Mulder . This rocks ! ",1
 Whoops . That's my pager . I had to get it for work . ,1
" You have a pager ? ! That's a little high-tech for you , Stu . Are you sure you know how to use it ? ",2
" Well , I know how to turn it off ! ",1
" No , you don't ! It's still beeping ! Come on , hand it over and I'll turn it off for you . ",3
I want to meet you . Are you free this evening ? ,3
" Well , actually , I'm not free today . Do you have anything urgent ? ",2
" No , I just want to meet you . ",1
 How about tomorrow instead . ,3
" Hmm , that's all right . Shall we meet at the bar near the beach ? ",3
 All right . See you then . ,4
"Do you have any tissue , Eve ? I've used all mine . ",2
 Here . Are you all right ? ,2
 Thanks . I am all right . It's just my nose . It must be an allergy . Do you have any aspirin ? I have a terrible headache . ,3
 I don't have an aspirin . Perhaps you should go to a doctor . ,3
" No , no . I am okay . It's the weather . It was warm and sunny this morning and now it's chilly and raining . ",4
" Really , John . I still think you should go to a doctor . You've been sneezing ever since you entered the office this morning . Why don't you take this afternoon off ? If you don't want to see a doctor , at least you can go home and have a good rest . ",3
" I can't . I am already behind the schedule . Besides , you know Mr . White . He would think that I was putting him on . ",4
" You didn't do anything but sneeze this morning , and you can't do anything this afternoon like this . Gee ! You've got a fever . ",1
" Do I ? Oh , no . ",2
 Listen to me . You go home now . I will call my doctor and have him go over . Ok ? ,3
 What about Mr.White ? ,2
 I'll handle him . Now go home . I'll call you after work . ,3
" Thanks a lot , Eve . Goodbye . ",4
"How about a movie on Sunday , Mum ? ",3
" Well , I'm afraid your father's not interested in modern films . ",4
 We could find a classical one . ,3
 That sounds fine . ,4
"You are in love with Mary , right ? ",2
 You are pulling my legs ! ,1
 I am not blind . Anyone can see that with half an eye . ,1
I'm going on a cruise this summer . ,1
 No kidding ? ,2
 My brother won a free trip and he's taking me . ,1
 You can't beat that . ,1
Where do you spend the weekend ? ,2
 We've a country house . ,1
 That's nice . ,1
" Join us , will you ? ",3
 That'd be great ! Thank you . ,4
How's your work ? ,2
" Good , thanks . How about you ? ",2
 Not bad . But we have lost a few of staff lately . ,1
 Why ? ,2
 Because of the low salaries . ,1
 But your company is huge . Can't they afford to pay the staff decent wages ? ,2
 I don't know why . ,1
 Why don't you give them a suggestion ? ,3
 May be I can have a try . But I'm on vacation now . ,4
"Good morning , Linda . How have you been ? ",2
 Pretty bad . I ’ Ve had a bad cold for three days and still can ’ t get rid of it . ,1
 I ’ m sorry to hear that . Is there anything else I can do ? ,2
" No , thanks . ",1
" Well , I hope you ’ ll feel better soon . ",1
 Thank you for your concern . ,1
Are you going to watch the Indy Five Hundred on TV this weekend ? ,2
 I'm not really into racecar driving . ,1
" You were when we were in high school . That , and baseball . ",1
" Yeah , well , times change . Look at you-you're a father now . You can't say that you haven't changed . ",1
" True , but I still have to watch my baseball . The season's in full swing now . ",1
" I mean , I know spring training's over , but I'm just not into all that . ",1
 Hello ? Is the real Taylor in there ? ,2
How do you feel ? ,2
 I'm nervous as can be . ,1
I can't believe it ! I lost . ,1
" It looks like you have to buy tickets for us , Jason . And we're not going to see an action movie ! ",1
" That's not fair , you got all the easy questions . ",1
 I guess that's just the luck of the draw . ,1
 I want a rematch . Let's play again . ,3
" Sorry , not tonight ! ",4
do you need a hand ? ,2
" no , I can handle it . Thanks anyway . ",1
 are you sure you don't need any help ? ,2
" well , maybe just a little . I can't seem to make it fit . ",1
" I swear , the overhead compartments on these planes just keep getting smaller and smaller ! ",1
 that's so true . thanks for your help . Are you in the aisle seat in this row ? ,2
 yes . What about you ? ,2
 I'm in the middle seat . ,1
" oh , I guess I'll let you through then . ",1
 thanks . sorry for making you get out of your seat again . ,1
 that's alright . I notice you have a few newspapers there . Would you mind lending me one ? ,3
" no , not at all . Which one would you like--the New York Times or the Guardian ? ",2
" I prefer the British paper , but I'll read whatever one you aren't going to read right away . ",3
" I was just going to do a little Sudoku while we wait for the plane to take off , so the Guardian is all yours . ",4
 thanks a lot . That's really nice of you . Would you like a piece of gum ? ,3
 that would be great . thanks . ,4
"Are you listening to me , Dan ? ",2
" I'm with you , Jane . ",1
 What did I just say ? ,2
" Well , uh ... I didn't catch the last part . ",1
 Just what I thought ! ,1
"Man , I ’ m freaking out ! You gotta help me ! ",3
" Whoa , whoa , take it easy , relax . Geez , you ’ re sweating like a pig ! What ’ s going on ? ",2
" I can ’ t go through with this ! I just can ’ t ! I ’ m not ready for marriage ! What was I thinking ? I ’ m only thirty five years old ! I ’ Ve got my entire life ahead of me , adventures waiting ! I can ’ t settle down yet ! ",1
 What are you talking about ? It wasn ’ t more than a month ago that you were rambling on about how you are tired of living the life of a bachelor and how you envy your friends that have a family ! ,2
 I know . I know ! ,1
" Let ’ s think this through . First of all , you cannot leave Amy at the altar . Not only will she be humiliated and kill you , but she is the woman that you love and the woman of your dreams ! Why would you want to end that or jeopardize it like this ? Second of all , you are just getting cold feet . You know deep down inside that you want to marry her , so cut the crap and do it ! ",1
" You ’ re right . I ’ m being crazy ! Ok , I ’ m ready , let ’ s do this ! ",3
 Great ! Phew ! That was a close one ! You had me going there for a minute I thought I was gonna have to slap some sense into you . ,4
"Hi , why do you look so depressed today , Mike ? ",2
 I had a terrible quarrel with my neighbor yesterday . ,1
 How come ? ,2
" It is a long story . Basically , she thought I had laughed at her while I didn't . ",1
 I know everyone suffers when he is misunderstood . But why not take it easy ? ,3
 Yeah . It's so nice of you to comfort me . ,4
Who's that over here ? ,2
 That's the new teacher . ,1
 What do you think of the teacher ? ,2
 She's very nice . ,1
 What does she teach ? ,2
" English , of course . ",1
 Is she your teacher ? ,2
 Yes . She teaches our class three times a week . ,1
 Can she speak Chinese to her students ? ,2
 Not very much . ,1
 It's a good thing you can speak English ! ,1
The teacher just canceled the test . ,1
 Are you kidding ? ,2
Hello ? ,2
 Hi Steve . This is Mike . What are you doing ? ,2
" Oh , hi . I was just watching TV . ",1
 There's nothing to watch right now . ,1
 I know . I was watching a re-run . I have nothing to do and I was bored . ,1
 Me too . Let's get together and do something . ,3
" I'd like to , but I have to meet my parents in an hour for dinner . How about tomorrow ? ",3
 Yeah . Let's plan something tomorrow . ,4
 Did you hear the weather forecast for tomorrow ? ,2
 I think it is going to be the same as today . Clear and sunny . ,1
 That's great . We can do something outdoors then . ,3
 Are there any special events going on tomorrow ? ,2
 Yeah . I think there's a live outdoor concert by the river tomorrow . ,1
 Oh yeah . I heard about that too . Let's go check it out . ,1
 Do you know what time it starts ? ,2
 It starts at one PM . ,1
" Let's meet for lunch at eleven thirty and afterwards , we can head over there . ",3
 Perfect . I'll see you in front of the apartment at eleven thirty . ,4
Would you go to the bookstore with me ? ,3
 It sounds a good idea . Let ’ s go . ,4
 Do you know Jeffery has published his second detective novel ? ,2
" Yes . I heard about that . And I know you want to buy it , but I ’ m not interested in detective novels . ",1
 So what are you interested in ? ,2
" Magazines about fashions , such as Cosmo Polian . ",1
 I know that magazine . It ’ s very popular . ,1
 Yes . I can lend you some . ,3
 Thank you . But I ’ m not interested . ,4
When can we expect you for dinner ? Can you come tonight ? ,3
 Not tonight . I promised to go to a concert with my sister . ,4
 Well ... How about Friday then ? ,3
 That sounds fine . ,4
 Good . Shall we say seven o'clock ? ,3
" I'll be there . You're still a fabulous cook , aren't you ? ",2
 That'll be for you to decide . I've got a new dish that I want to try out on you . ,1
 I'm ready . I'll look forward to it all Friday ! ,4
"I don ’ t understand why you always look so happy , so energetic . It seems like you ’ Ve got good news everyday . ",1
 Really ? Do I look happy all the time ? ,2
 All I know is you look quite differently from other teachers . ,1
" Oh , do you know why ? Actually , it ’ s easy . Because I always exercise . My exercise , I think , is very hard . I often feel very good after conquering these difficulties . I feel alive ! ",2
" Oh , I know . I saw you doing pull-ups one time on the campus 5 and some students trying to imitate you . ",1
" Yeah , they are doing it for fun . Seldom would people like my exercise . It ’ s difficult and boring . ",1
 It ’ s true . Many students do the exercise when they have to . We have P . E . once a week . ,1
 But I think Chinese students need to exercise more . Besides exercise will help them learn new things better . Don ’ t students want to have a good memory ? ,2
 Of course . I didn ’ t know that . I only know exercise makes bodies stronger . I should take some exercise then . Do you have any suggestions ? ,2
" Well , do what you like to do . It can be anything . Jogging , doing aerobics , going bicycling , and playing ping-pong . Absolutely anything . Doing three or more workouts a week is good for you . But remember to do some stretches first . ",3
" Oh , I know . Thank you . ",4
Which kind of sport do you like to watch ? ,2
" Basketball , football , table tennis . I will watch them on TV . ",1
 So you must like NBA game . ,1
" Yeah , it is my favorite . Many Chinese people including women and children would like to concern the game . I think they want to see the performance of coming and YiJianLian , the Chinese players in NBA . ",1
 What kind of sport do you like to participate in ? ,2
 I am good at tennis and skiing . What about you ? ,2
" I prefer the indoor sports , such as bowling , badminton and squash . ",1
 Moderate exercise is really important for health . ' Life lies in movement . ' ,1
 How about playing tennis with me ? ,3
 Good idea . I will take the racket . ,4
"Good morning , Jerry.How ' s everything ? ",2
" Fine , just fine.Thanks . ",1
 Doing anything for lunch ? ,3
" Well , as a matter of fact , I've got a lunch date with Bob Thomas . ",4
Excuse me . Can you tell me how to get started using these machines ? ,3
 Of course . Are you a new member here ? ,2
 Yes . ,1
 Welcome . My name is Johnson . ,1
 Nice to meet you . ,1
 Do you have any experience using weights ? ,2
" No , I don't . So I need some help . ",3
" Well , first it is important to go through a good stretch.You must warm up properly so that you don't hurt yourself on the machines . ",3
" Yes , I know that.Derek just led me through the warm up in the aerobics room.So I'm ready , I think . I can start using the machines . ",4
 Alright . Great . Then we must get a card for you . ,3
 What do you mean--a membership card ? I already have one . ,4
" No . Not that . I mean a training card.The card allows you to keep track of how much weight you use on each machine.Here , let me show you . ",3
 I'm ready . ,4
" Now , you can see that on this card there are all the machines listed.So , when you go through the series of twelve machines , you enter in the number of repetitions you do.And you also enter in the weight at which you set the machine . ",3
 I see . So this card helps me to keep track of my progress . ,4
" Yes . And it also reminds you what is a suitable weight for each machine.Today , I will go through the machines with you one by one . I will show you how to use them.And we will determine what is a good starting weight for you . ",3
 Alright . Great . ,4
" So you write your name and member number at the top of the card.And then , after you exercise each time , you file the card here . ",3
 Great . Why don't we start on the machines ? ,3
 Are you alright ? Can you do more ? ,2
 I'm sorry . I know there are still seven machines . But I'm exhausted . ,1
 That's okay . Don't worry.It ' s important not to push yourself . Especially not at the beginning . ,1
 What can I do though ? I don't know the proper settings for the rest of the machines . ,2
" We can just go through them next time . It's no problem . Really.The most important thing is to know your limits.So if you feel burned out now , it is good to stop.Because if you strain a muscle or hurt your back , then you won't be able to exercise for a couple weeks . Right ? ",3
 Yes . I suppose it's best to stop . ,4
Don't be afraid . Give it a try . ,3
 Okay . ,4
what are you doing ? ,2
" I'm just trying to complete today's crossword puzzle . Whenever I get the time , I like to do the crossword puzzles in the paper . ",1
" you really like brains that make you think , don't you ? ",2
 I guess you could say that . What kind of games do you like ? ,2
 I guess the games I like the most are the ones that I'm good at ! ,1
 Doesn't everyone ? Which games are those ? ,2
" Well , I like to play darts . Whenever I go to a bar , I usually play for a few hours . ",1
 Did you play a lot of games when you were little ? ,2
 My parents used to love to play checkers and dominoes . We used to have family tournaments every weekend . ,1
 Do you still like playing those games ? ,2
" Not at all . I never really did , to be honest . What about you ? Did your family used to play games together ? ",2
 Everyone in my family really enjoys playing card games . ,1
 Some of my friends play cards on the internet . Have you ever tried that ? ,2
" No , I prefer to play with people I know . ",1
 How about mah-jong ? ,2
" It's a popular game with some people , but I've never played it . ",1
 I thought everyone in your country were experts at mah-jong ! ,1
" I hate to disappoint you , but unlike what most people think , we aren't all exactly the same ! ",1
I didn't like my brother's batting around without doing anything useful . ,1
" Maybe he is trying to find a job . When he finds one , everything will be settled . ",1
 I hope so . ,1
They got a divorce at last . ,1
" It's inevitable . Their love wasbuilt on the sand , and this is why their marriage has landed on the rocks . ",1
 You said it . Love but on the sand will soon be on the rocks . ,1
 That give us a good lesson . ,1
"Do you like traveling , Kathy ? ",2
" I like traveling for pleasure to get places for vacation for instance . But I don ’ t like traveling to work , waiting for buses , or ... ",1
 Or getting stuck in traffic jams when you ’ re driving . ,1
 Exactly . ,1
Can you believe that Susan got married ? ,2
 Really ? I remember she said if she would remain single . Is the man very rich ? ,2
 No . That ’ s what is surprising me . ,1
 You means she didn ’ t marry a rich man . ,1
 He ’ s a postman . ,1
 I thought she would marry a fortune . ,1
What sort of things do you grow in your garden ? ,2
" I grow a variety of things , so that something is in bloom all year round . ",1
 When is your garden at its best ? ,2
" It looks best in spring , when the plum and cherry blossoms are out . ",1
Good afternoon ! ,1
" Good afternoon ! Sit down , please.How are you ? ",2
" I'm very well , thank you.How are you ? ",2
" Very well too , thank you very much.Isn ' t it a lovely day ? ",2
" Yes , it's beautiful , but it's also very hot . ",1
 Yes . ,1
 What's the weather like in your country ? ,2
 Mm ... It's quite warm now . ,1
 Where do you live ? ,2
 In London.Where do you live ? ,2
 Here.Near this school . ,1
"Oh , no ! Now I'll be late . ",1
 Can I give you a hand ? ,3
" Yes , I'd appreciate it if you could drive me downtown . ",4
 Sure thing . I've got time . ,1
What a great weekend that was ! ,1
 My feelings exactly . ,1
 I really enjoy the beach in the summer . ,1
 I couldn't agree with you more . ,1
 We should come here more often . ,3
 You are absolutely right . ,4
 I'd like to come back next weekend . ,1
 That's exactly the way I feel . ,1
"What's this , I wonder ? ",2
 I'm not sure.Let me have a look ... It could be a coffee grinder . ,1
 A coffee grinder ? ,2
" Yes , it must be used for grinding coffee beans . ",1
" Oh , that would be very useful . ",1
We've got a new manager in our department . ,1
" Oh ? You hoped to get that job , didn't you ? ",2
" Yes , I did . ",1
" I'm sorry . That's too bad . Who is it ? Who got the job , I mean ? ",2
" Someone called Drexler . Carl Drexler . He's been with the company onlytwo years . I've been here longer . And I know more about the job , too ",1
 Hmm . Why do you think they gave it to him and not to you ? ,2
" Because I'm the wrong sex , of course ! ",1
 You mean you didn't get the job because you're a woman ? ,2
" Yes , that was probably it ! It isn't fair . ",1
 What sort of clothes does he wear ? ,2
 A dark suit . White shirt . A tie . Why ? ,2
 Perhaps that had something to do with it . ,1
 You mean you think I didn't get the job because I come to work in jeansand a sweater ? ,2
" It's possible , isn't it ? ",2
 Do you really think I should wear different clothes ? ,2
 Well . . . perhaps you should think about it . ,3
 Why should I wear a skirt ? Or a dress ? ,2
 I'm not saying you should . I'm saying you should think about it . That's all ! ,3
 Why should I do that ? I'm good at my job ! That's the only important thing ! ,1
 Hmm . Perhaps it should be the only important thing . But it isn't . Not in this company . ,1
"It's a sunny day , isn't it ? ",2
" Yes , it is . I'm Jennifer . Nice to meet you . ",1
" My name is David . Nice to meet you , too . ",1
 Are you American ? ,2
" No , I'm a Britisher . Where do you come from ? ",2
 I come from America . Are you a freshman ? ,2
 Yes . What about you ? ,2
" Me , too . ",1
 Great . Maybe we can study and play games together . I think we can be good friends . ,3
 Yeah . Anytime . ,4
You keep bowling spares but no strike . ,1
" I don't know why , but I think there's something wrong with my hands . I couldn't seem to be able to control it on the first ball . ",1
" I don't think it was the problem with your hands , you did several excellent spares . You have no problem with your hands . ",1
 Then why couldn't I get strike on the first ball ? ,2
" The problem is you are too nervous . You want to have a strike so much , so you deliver the ball too hard . And when it comes to the I second roll , there's no pressure . That's why you could bowl all those spares . ",1
 Really ? I will try again . ,2
"Nice to see you , Patrick . ",1
 Bob ! I hear your team won the match . ,1
 Yeah . All of us tried our best . ,1
 Congratulations ! ,1
 Thanks . ,1
Are you free on the thirteenth in the afternoon ? ,2
 No I'm afraid not . I'm meeting Ruth then . How about the fourteenth in the morning ? ,3
 I'm sorry . I'm attending a meeting at the Hilton then . ,4
 What about the next day ? ,3
 No . I'm busy then too . I'm meeting Dorothy Heath at North Bridge Road . Are you free on Thursday afternoon ? ,3
" Yes , I think I am . Let's meet for lunch at mouth restaurant . ",3
 Good idea ! Is two o'clock okay ? ,2
 That's fine . See you there ! ,4
Did you enjoy the movie ? ,2
" Oh , it's really a drag . ",1
 Sorry to hear that . I think it's even better than On the Golden pond . ,1
 Hell with it ! Nobody will give it an Academy award ! ,1
Hi Jackie . You don't look too well . What's going on ? ,2
 It's nothing . I'm just a little stressed out . ,1
 Why ? What's stressing you out ? ,2
" School . Since I was working part time , I had a difficult time keeping up with class . Now that we have exams coming up , I'm totally freaking out . ",1
 The best thing to do is study as much as you can . I'm sure you'll do alright . ,3
 I hope so . I guess I won't be sleeping for the next 3 days . That's what it'll take . ,1
 I have to study for an exam too . Why don't we study together . We can encourage each other . ,3
 That will be great . ,4
The new webpage design is much more effective than before . I feel confident it will rope in a lot more business because of its user-friendly format . ,1
 Why do you think the new page is so much better than the old page ? I thought the old page wasn't half bad ... ,2
" The old page was okay , alright , but there wasn't a big influence in our sales volume , because the site wasn't developed with an eye towards the marketing aspect . Now it's different . We got our marketing department team in on the action , and the results are smashing ... ",1
 What changes were made from the old page to the new page ? ,2
" First , the visitors to the site are encouraged to give their contact information . They can sign up for a free monthly drawing . Once we've got their info , it goes into a database for future marketing mailers and advertising targeting . Also , there are clear links to descriptions of our products and services , so as to give confidence to new customers . We also added a specific area for on-line customer service ... So far we've gotten a ton of positive feedback ... ",1
 Great ! ,1
Did you know that drinking beer helps you sing better ? ,2
 Are you sure ? How do you know ? ,2
" Well , usually people think I'm a terrible singer , but after we all have a few beers , they say I sound a lot better ! ",1
" Well , I heard that if you drink enough beer , you can speak foreign languages better ... ",1
Pardon me . Could you please pass me the tissue ? ,3
" Sure , here you are . ",4
" Thanks , I didn't expect the dish to be so spicy . Are you ok ? ",2
" Yeah , I think the food is alright , it's not too spicy though it's a little salty for me . But you are Chinese , you should have known better . ",1
" Well , not every Chinese can handle spicy food in the way people from Sichuan and Guizhou provinces can . Back where I come from , people don't eat a lot of papers and chilies . ",1
" Oh , I see how this food can be really hard for you . I can sympathize with that . I stayed in Sichuan for a year . The food was difficult at the beginning . Every dish was so spicy . After a while though , I got used to the taste , and now I won't consider anything a real dish if it isn't spicy . ",1
" Yeah , you can increase you tolerance for spicy food , but so far , I haven't had the need or the opportunity . Every time I try spicy food , it is a total disaster for my nose and eyes . ",1
" I completely understand . I didn't intend on liking spicy food at first either , but when you have no other choices , you've got to adapt . ",1
" Yeah , I guess that's a typical example of ' when in Rome , do as the Romans do . ' ",1
 Exactly . ,1
"Tom , Christmas Day is coming . Merry Christmas to you . ",1
 Thank you . And a merry Christmas to you ! ,1
Could you lend your bike to me for several days ? ,3
 How long would you like to keep it ? ,2
 Till the end of the week . ,1
" Yes , that'd be all right . ",4
Don't you feel a little strange taking the place of your old boss after he was demoted ? ,2
" Yes , at first I felt very awkward . After Bill was demoted and then resigned , it was kind of like somebody died ! I mean the atmosphere in the office was like a funeral parlor or something . And then I was afraid people would look at me as a traitor for filling in his spot when the management asked me to ... ",1
 Did they mutiny ? ,2
" Thankful , no . I guess everyone understands the opportunity I had to step into a leadership role is so great for my career . I'm really moving up the ladder now that I'm considered a supervisor . After a couple weeks , it was like nothing happened . ",1
 It is a really good chance for you to get more exposure at work . supervisors get to take the credit for all the hard work of the people under them . ,1
" Yeah , and they also take the blame , that's what happened to my old boss ... ",1
How about a game of tennis ? ,3
 Okay . Loser has to take out the trash for a month . ,4
 It's a deal . ,3
 See you in the court . ,4
"Are you feeling better today , Bill ? ",2
" Well , it's hard to say . I cough a lot in the evening . ",1
 You'd better give up smoking . It's bad for your health . ,3
" You're right , but you know , it's hard to give up an old habit . ",4
 But you should make up your mind first . ,3
" You know , I often have to work till late at night . I need something to keep me awake . ",4
 Why don't you go to bed and get up early ? You'll have the same time for work . ,3
 Thank you for your advice ! I'll try it . ,4
"Hi , John , how was your vacation ? ",2
" Awesome , we went to Australia and New Zealand . ",1
 That must have been wonderful . Do anything interesting ? ,2
" Well , we went bungee jumping when we were in Australia . ",1
 Wow ! Isn ’ t that dangerous ? ,2
" A little , but the rush was worth it . ",1
 Tell me about it . ,3
 We jumped off a bridge and fell 500 feet before the bungee cord caught us . ,1
 500 feet ! I would never be able to do that . ,1
" Yeah , It was scary , but exhilarating . ",1
What did her boss say to you ? ,2
 He asked me to beef up in the work . ,1
 Yeah . You look so unhappy recently . What ’ s the matter . ,2
" Nothing , thanks . I am just not in the mood these days . ",1
"Hi , Tina , it's Joe . ",1
" Hi , Joe . ",1
 What's the weather like there today ? ,2
 It's really cold . It snowed all day and the school closed early . ,1
 What's the temperature ? ,2
 It's 20 degrees below zero now . It was even colder this morning . ,1
 Have you heard what the weather is going to be like tomorrow ? ,2
 I was watching the news a little earlier . They said it's probably going to snow tomorrow . ,1
 I really don't like the winter . I wish it were summer . ,1
 Me too . How's the weather where you are ? ,2
" It's not too bad , but it's pretty cold here too . I heard it's going to be a little warmer tomorrow . ",1
"Mom , I just finished my paper . Can you proofread it before I hand it in ? ",3
" Sure , let ’ s take a look . Sweetie , this is terrific . Your ideas are so original . ",4
 Thanks . ,1
 I can tell you worked hard on it . ,1
 I really did ! I started thinking about what I wanted to say three weeks ago . ,1
" Well , it was definitely worth all the time . ",1
 Let ’ s just hope my teacher agrees . ,1
How about doing shopping this weekend ? ,3
 What're you going to buy ? ,2
 Sportshoes.Will you go with me ? ,2
 OK . ,1
Merry Christmas ! ,1
 Huh ? ,2
 I said Merry Christmas ! Don't you know that Christmas is almost here ? ,2
" It is ? Oh , that's nice . ",2
 Huh ? Didn't you know ? Aren't you excited ? ,2
" Actually , I'd forgotten about it . ",1
 Forgotten about it ? How could you ? ,2
" Because I'm not Christian , I'm Jewish . ",1
" Oh , I'm sorry . I didn't know . ",1
 It's all right . There are so many Christians in America that everybody takes it for granted that I'm Christian . ,1
 I guess so . So what do you do around this time of year ? ,2
" Well , I'll celebrate Hanukah soon , but that's not as important to us as Christmas is to you . Mainly I'll just enjoy the holiday break . ",1
" Well , would you be horribly offended if I invited you to a Christmas party at my house ? ",3
 Not at all . A party is a party . I'll be happy to come . ,4
It's all over . I'm bankrupt . ,1
 Don't worry . Everything will be fine . ,1
"Bill , Happy Halloween ! ",1
 Happy Halloween ! What creature are you going to dress up as ? ,2
 I will dress up as a vampire with big fangs . ,1
 May I have a look at your costume ? ,3
 Sure . Wait a moment . ( Several minutes later ) Here you are . ,4
 I like your black clothes and your fangs are cool . ,1
 I will bite many beautiful girls on the neck tonight . Maybe I will suck their blood . ,1
 Haha . Wish you good luck . ,1
I think that ’ s settled . ,1
 I'm tired of your cut-and-dried opinions . Who do you think you are ! ,1
 How dare you speak to me like this . ,2
 Why not ? ,2
"Hey , Karen . Look like you got some sun this weekend . ",1
 Yeah ? I guess so . I spent the weekend at beach . ,1
 That ’ s great . Where did you stay ? ,2
" Some friends of my parents live out there , and they invited me there . ",1
" So , what did you do out there ? I mean besides bask in the sun , obviously . ",2
 I jogged up and down the beach and played volleyball . You know I never realized how hard it is to run on sand . I couldn ’ t get through a whole game before I had to sit down . ,1
 Not to mention cooler . Did you go swimming ? ,2
" I wanted to , but the water is too cold , and I just wetted in up to my knees . ",1
 It all sounds so relaxing . I wish I could get away to the beach like that . ,1
 It looks like you could use it . Don ’ t tell me you spent the weekend in the library again . ,1
"OK class , so today we are going to continue with our anatomy class , today we will review everything we have learned . Can anyone tell me what the first major organ is ? ",2
 The brain ! ,1
" That's right , the brain ! It serves as a control center for the body , handling the processes of the central nervous system as well as cognition . Then what major organ is in our chest ? ",2
 The heart ! ,1
" Very good ! It pumps blood throughout the body , using the circulatory system such as blood vessels and veins . Now let's not forget that our lungs provide oxygen to our heart and body to keep us alive ! Now what about the organs that help us digest food ? ",2
 The stomach and intestines ! ,1
 Very good ! Let's not forget that the stomach is the one that breaks down our food and our intestines process that food and then expel the waste . Are we forgetting anything ? ,2
" Yeah ! Our kidneys , liver and bladder ! ",1
" Oh yes , you are right . Very important organs indeed . ",1
" So what do these organs do , teacher ? ",2
" Well , mumm , they ... Time for a break ! We can talk about it when you get back . ",1
It's not good for business recently . ,1
 Not good for business ? I don't see eye to eye with you.The new policy offers new opportunities . ,2
 Too risky anyway.It ' s necessary to look before you leap . ,1
Do you know how to play go ? ,2
 It's easy . All you have to do is to use your pieces to surround the opponent's pieces and then take over all of his territory . ,1
 But I heard it is very difficult to play . ,1
" It's easier said than done . When you actually play , it can be very frustrating . ",1
Linda ? Is that you ? I haven't seen you in ages ! ,2
 Hi George ! It's good to see you ! ,1
 What have you been up to ? ,2
 I just opened up my own business not long ago . ,1
 Good for you ! What are you doing ? ,2
 I'm a professional party planner here in the city . I do catering and all that . ,1
 I knew some day I would be able to profit from your love of fun ! ,1
" Well , I don't know about the profit part yet . But I am really having fun ! ",1
"So , what ’ s new in the kitchen ? That refrigerator is new , isn ’ t it ? ",2
" Yes . I needed a large one . Before , I had a separate refrigerator and freezer , but this has both combined into one . ",1
 That ’ s usual nowadays . You ’ Ve added a few shelves too . ,1
 Yes . You know I ’ Ve been cooking more kind of food recently and I needed some extra space for spices and ingredients . ,1
 Did you buy new cupboards too ? ,2
" No , I didn ’ t . I gave them a really good clean , so they just look new . The worktop was in poor condition , so I had a new one added . ",1
 I see that you have bought several new pots and pans and utensils . ,1
" Yes , I have . I need them to help me with these new dished I ’ m trying to make . I need a little more practice before I invite guests over . ",1
" Looking at the spice rack , I ’ d say you ’ Ve been learning how to make asian food . ",3
" Yes . I ’ Ve always likes Indian and thai food , so I ’ Ve been trying to make dishes from those countries . I ’ m pretty good at making curries now , but I still need practice at making thai food . ",4
" Both kinds of food are becoming popular.Nowadays , it ’ s very easy to pick up the ingredients at the supermarket . ",1
 I hope you can stay for dinner . I need a guinea pig ! ,1
"How do you like skiing , Pat ? ",2
 I love it . All my life I wanted to learn to ski . Finally I took lessons last year . ,1
 I suppose skiing is easy for you . ,1
" No , quite the opposite . I thought I'd never stop falling down . Then all of a sudden I started skiing much better . ",1
 I see . Do you ski often ? ,2
 Every chance I get . On weekends I ski all day long . Sometimes I even ski at night . ,1
 That sounds great . ,1
" Oh , yes . The ski slopes are well lit . It's really nice to ski at night . Why don't you learn to ski ? ",3
 Not on your life ! I know I'd break my leg ,4
 Don't be so frightened . It's just a skill . ,1
"Hi , Dave . This is Zina . ",1
 Zina ? Zina the Snake ? ,2
 I got your e-mail a couple of months back . ,1
 Yeah ? Which one was that ? ,2
" The one that said , You're a creep . From me you won't hear another peep . I hope you wreck your jeep . ",1
 Right . That one . Did it work ? ,2
"Hello , my name is Bill Martin and we have a reservation for party tonight . ",3
" Yes , what can I do for you ? ",2
 I need to cancel that . We have had a last minute change of plans . ,3
 I see . Would you like me to reschedule you for another night ? ,2
" OK , we will let you know as early as possible . By the way , will we be able to get a refund on this cancellation ? ",2
 Certainly . ,1
 Thank you very much . ,4
 That's all right . I hope we can help you at some other time . Good-bye . ,4
 Good-bye . ,1
Can I use your laptop for a while ? ,2
" Sure , go ahead . ",1
" Oh , isn't your computer Wi-Fi capable ? ",2
" Yes , it is . You want go online ? there are no wi-fi hotspots around . ",2
" Oh my , no internet access is killing me . ",1
" Can't you wait till you get home ? then you can surf the internet using the broadband , wireless connection or whatever you like . ",2
" No , I'm not feeling myself . I just want to check my emails , visit my favorite websites and chat with my friends . ",1
" Now I see , you must be suffering from discomgoogolation . ",1
 What does that mean ? there's nothing wrong with me . ,2
" Well , the term ' discomgoogolation ' comes from ' discombobulate ' and ' google ' . Because floods of information are just a mouse click away , net users are very likely to become addicted to the web . ",1
 That's alright . I just can't bear losing track of all the latest information . It almost drives me crazy . ,1
" Then , you're probably addicted . ",1
"Sally , I ’ m tired of this Western food . I really miss my mother ’ s Sichuan cooking . ",1
 I ’ m sure you do miss that type of cooking . But can ’ t you try to get used to Western food ? ,2
" I have tried . But Americans like butter , bread , sugar , and cream too much . ",1
" I suppose you ’ re right , Lee . Maybe that ’ s why so many Westerners are overweight . ",1
" It ’ s interesting that Americans work very hard at their jobs , do not take naps during the day , and yet they can be so heavy . ",1
" You see , because we are often busy working , we eat too much fast food , and that food is very fattening . ",1
Tell me something about your Valentine's Day . ,3
" Ok , on that day , boys usually give roses to the sweet hearts and girls give them chocolate to return . ",4
 So romantic . Young people must have lot of fun . ,1
" Yeah , that is the holiday is hot , isn't it ? ",2
What will happen to the children if you break up ? ,2
 That's a relief for me and a misery for the children . ,1
 Why don't you make up with John . ,3
 It's too late . ,4
Have you ever been to Japan ? I'm going in the fall . ,2
" Yeah , I've been there twice . ",1
 Really ? Tell me about it . What's it like ? ,2
" Oh , it's fantastic . ",1
 Where did you go ? ,2
" On my first trip I went to Tokyo , and on my second trip I visited Kyoto . ",1
 What did you think of Tokyo ? ,2
" Very big and exciting , but very crowded , too . ",1
 Yeah . I've seen pictures of the crowds ! ,1
 And the restaurant are excellent ... but they're kind of expensive . ,1
 And how about Kyoto ? ,2
 Kyoto is lovely . It's full of beautiful old temples and gardens.It ' s a very historic city . ,1
 How was the weather ? ,2
" I was in Tokyo in August , and it was really hot and humid . I went to Kyoto in October.It was hot and sunny , but there was no humidity . ",1
 Sounds perfect . I can't wait ! ,1
Where do you live now ? ,2
 I live in Haitian District where there are lot of universities . ,1
 Which street do you live on ? ,2
 I live at No . 50 Xingu Street . ,1
Who did the stupid thing ? ,2
 Maybe it was Dick . ,1
 I don't think so . Dick has been on the ball and never does things like that . ,1
 Then it must be a naughty boy who did it . ,1
Can I help you ? ,2
 Yes . I'd like to borrow these books . ,3
 Just a second . I'll see if I can find them for you . ,3
 Thanks . ,4
 Here you are . You must return them within a month . ,3
 What happens if I'm not finished with them in a month ? ,2
 You can come in and renew them unless someone else has reserved them . ,1
 OK.Thank you very much for your trouble . ,1
 No trouble at all . So long . ,1
"Hi Sam , would you like to come for a curry with us next Friday ? ",3
" Sure , I love curry . Who else is coming ? ",2
" Jane , Susan , Pete and two colleagues of mine from work . ",1
" I have no plans for Friday , so curry would be great . Which restaurant do you have in mind ? ",2
 Susan suggested the one on Main Street . She says it is very good . ,1
 Which one is that ? ,2
" You know , the one just on the corner with Oxford Street . There is a large pharmacy next door . ",1
" Oh yes , I know which one you mean . I have never been there , but I looked at their menu once and it did look good . ",1
 Okay then . I think we will all meet outside ? ,3
 What time ? ,2
 At 8 o'clock . I will make the reservation . ,1
 That's good . See you on Friday . ,4
Did you have a part-time job when you were still in school ? ,2
" No , I was way too busy studying all the time . How about you ? ",2
" Yeah , I worked about twenty hours a week in a pizza restaurant . ",1
 What was that like ? ,2
 It was always very busy there . ,1
 What did you do ? ,2
 I stood behind the register and took pizza orders . ,1
 Did you get any perks on the job ? ,2
" Yeah , I got to eat as much pizza as I could for free . ",1
Did you like the play ? ,2
" Not really . It's a dull one , and the production isn't satisfactory , either . ",1
 You're absolutely right . The acting could be better . ,1
" To be fair , though , both the costumes and scenery are marvelous . ",1
